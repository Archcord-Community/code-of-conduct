## Preface <a name="preface"></a>

You also agree to comply with Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Failure to comply may result in your removal from our community.

## Section 1 - General Community Policies <a name="section-1---general-community-policies"></a>

These policies ensure a safe and respectful environment for all our members.

### 1.1 - Discrimination <a name="11---discrimination"></a>

We do not tolerate any form of discrimination based on a person's gender, sexuality, race, religion, ethnicity,
nationality, language, age, body size, and other aspects of their identity. Our community is inclusive, and any
discriminatory actions may result in moderation action, depending on severity.

---

### 1.2 - Age Requirements <a name="12---age-requirements"></a>

By joining Archcord, you must be of the legal age in your jurisdiction to use our platforms. For Discord, you can review the conditions [here.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday). Whereas for Revolt, you can review the conditions [here.](https://support.revolt.chat/kb/safety/minimum-age-guidelines) Generally, you must be over 13, if users are found underage they will have their access to Archcord, and potentially partnered servers, revoked for at minimum 2 years.

Just because we have this condition does not mean you can make not safe for work jokes, see [1.3 Safe for Work Environment](#13---safe-for-work-environment) for more information.

---

### 1.3 - Safe for Work Environment <a name="13---safe-for-work-environment"></a>

We aim to maintain a Safe For Work (SFW) space for everyone. This includes guidelines for all forms of shared content:

#### 1.3.1 - Sexually Explicit Messages
- All messages must be safe for work. Explicit content (written, visual, auditory, or any other form) is prohibited.

#### 1.3.2 - Inappropriate User Profiles
- Profile content must remain appropriate for a community that includes minors, and adults. It cannot be
  sexually explicit, and/or hateful towards individuals/groups that are generally considered to be not harmful for
  society. Although you can have your own opinion about who's harmful or not, we will follow the widely accepted
  standards of society to define what's harmful or not

#### 1.3.3 - Animal Abuse, Gore, and Excessive Violence
- Do not share content depicting animal abuse, graphic gore, or excessive violence.

#### 1.3.4 - Self-Harm and Suicide
- Content related to self-harm or suicide is not allowed. Using such topics in a manipulative/negative
  way will result in immediate removal. We would also recommend not talking about these topics, because it might trigger
  someone that are facing the same issues in their own life, or they have someone close that has/had dealt with issues
  like this in the past.

---

### 1.4 - Anti-Elitism <a name="14---anti-elitism"></a>

Elitist behavior is not acceptable. Dismissing newcomers with comments like "RTFM" or "Read the Fucking Manual" undermines our community spirit. Additionally, knocking people for using certain distributions (eg. Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora or others) is not tolerated as we have a policy of welcoming all regardless of distribution.

### 1.5 - Cross-Server Drama <a name="15---cross-server-drama"></a>

You're welcome to discuss Archcord's internal matters—even outside the community—as long as it's done truthfully and respectfully. Deliberate falsification or manipulation may result in removal. Likewise, please don't bring drama or disputes from other communities into Archcord—we're here to keep things constructive and drama-free.

---

### 1.6 - Personally Identifiable Information <a name="16---personally-identifiable-information"></a>

Do not share personal information about others (e.g., real names, phone numbers, emails, addresses) without explicit consent. Doing so may result in immediate removal from the community.

---

### 1.7 - Discussion of Piracy <a name="17---discussion-of-piracy"></a>

While discussions around piracy may occur, promoting or sharing sources, resources, or links related to piracy is prohibited. A moderator reserves the right to withdraw from a conversation, withhold a conversation or stop a conversation regarding this topic at any time. Failure to stop when asked will result in punishment.

---

### 1.8 - Bot Commands <a name="18---bot-commands"></a>

Please use designated channels for bot commands to ensure clear conversation flow. You cannot abuse bots by repeatedly spamming the bot commands, as that will not only flood chat, but may have a negative impact on the bots performance affecting other members.

---

### 1.9 - Harassment of Members
Harrassing members in server or in DMs is not tolerated. We will not accept malicious interactions with a member and if you do so, we reserve the right to remove you from the server.

---

### 1.10 - No Politics
In Archcord we do not tolerate politics, this is due to the tension they cause and the fact they cause arguments. This is not a community we want, and we desire to remain apolitical and ensure that everyone is seen, heard and can get the help they need, regardless of political views.

## Section 2 - Voice Activity Conduct <a name="section-2---voice-activity-conduct"></a>

Voice channels have more relaxed guidelines but still require respectful behavior.

### 2.1 - Music Bot Trolling <a name="21---music-bot-trolling"></a>

Interrupting music sessions (e.g., mass skipping or altering the queue) is not allowed. Please wait your turn or use a separate voice channel.

---

### 2.2 - Sound Spam <a name="22---sound-spam"></a>

Spamming soundboard clips or audio in voice channels disrupts conversation and is prohibited. It may result in being server muted or removed from the voice channel.

---

### 2.3 - Streamed Content <a name="23---streamed-content"></a>

All streamed content must comply with our SFW policies and piracy guidelines. Streaming content you haven't legally purchased is not allowed and may result in removal from the community.

---

## Section 3 - Moderation Policies <a name="section-3---moderation-policies"></a>

By joining Archcord, you acknowledge our moderation practices.

### 3.1 - Moderator Discretion <a name="31---moderator-discretion"></a>

Moderators have the authority to remove members for valid reasons. However, you have the right to communicate if you disagree with a decision using our ticketing system. Moderators must exercise their discretion fairly.

---

### 3.2 - Moderation Transparency <a name="32---moderation-transparency"></a>

All moderation logs are publicly viewable to maintain transparency. If you have concerns or need clarifications, please open a ticket rather than discussing in general channels.

---

### 3.3 - Administrator Unsuitability <a name="33---administrator-unsuitability"></a>

If the community deems an administrator unfit, a public vote will be held. A 30-day transition period is provided during which the outgoing administrator remains until a successor is elected. For this process to proceed, at least **60% of the ENTIRE community** must agree via poll.

---

### 3.4 - Administrator Privilege <a name="34---administrator-privilege"></a>

Administrators may remove any member deemed unfit for the community, even if they are following the Code of Conduct. This power is not absolute and can be challenged. However, sensitive matters may require administrators to withhold specific details.

---

### 3.5 - Usability Clause <a name="35---usability-clause"></a>

Unless explicitely given written permission by an administrator of the Archcord Community you may not:
 - Use this for your community.
 - Take snippets of this for AI training.
 - Direct copy clauses.

You may:
 - Fork this to contribute to Archcord.
